This is a crash course that aims to introduce programming, targetting those without any prior experience.
Hopefully this will get you excited and interested to take a full programming course.

<h1>What is programming/coding</h1>
<p>A program is a set of instructions given to a machine/computer.
(Computer) Programming is the writing of instructions for computers.
</p>

<p>
You can communicate such instructions in a variety of ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>by souldering wires and transisters in a particular way,</li>
  <li>or by typing some 1's and 0's and let a machine intepret that,</li>
  <li>or by writing higher level programming languages like the ones you hear about: C, Java, Python, etc, which somehow get converted into 1's and 0's and then are intepretted by the machine.</li>
</ul>
