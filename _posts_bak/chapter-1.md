# 1. Classes and objects
A popular paradigm to organise programs is called Object Oriented Programming(OOP).
Here we meet some basic concepts in OOP.

## Classes/Types
Human are very good at classifiying things. We tell machines to think like that.
- ABC Secondary School is a school
- My pet Sam is a dog
- My pet Sam is a male

"School" is this class of institutions that have teachers and students and classrooms, conducts classes and churns out graduates.

"Dog" is this class of living things that are four-legged, tailed and can bark.

"Male" is this class of animals that have male genatilia, and reproduces together with a female.

Sam is considered a dog because he satisfies all the requirements to be a dog.

A thing X is considered to be of a type A if X satisfies all the requirements in the definition of A.

A type or a class of something is the requirement/idea/specification/definition of a collection of things.

> Plato's theory of Forms argue that non-physical *forms* represent the most accurate, the most perfect reality.
> A Vase Form has many manifestations of imperfect vases. A Cow Form has many manifestations of imperfect cows.

## Inheritance
Sam is both a dog and a male. He's a male dog.
A thing can belong to multiple classes, by satisfying the requirements of all of them.

Dogs are animals; Sam is a dog; hence Sam is an animal.
All dogs satisfies the requirements to be an animal all the time. We say dogs inherit
the requirements of animals - or that dogs are subclasses of animals.

## Object
Recall the example:

|         | have these                     | can do these                             |
|---------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|"School" |teachers students and classrooms| conducts classes and churns out graduates|
|"Dog"    |four legs and a tail            | bark                                     |
|"Male"   |male genatilia                  | reproduces together with a female        |

2 kinds of information helps us define a thing (helps us put a Class on it):

- Data/Attributes/What it has
- Methods/Actions/What it can do

An object is the encapsulation of data and methods.
