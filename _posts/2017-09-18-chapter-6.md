> Modularity is the degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined.

Programmers tries to break problems down into smaller ones, because we only know how to solve small tiny problems.
Smaller problems usually leads to small solutions, and that's good for modularity.
Everything and everybody should try to be more modular.

# Be focused
Do few things and do them well. When the code is focused on accomplishing a small, well defined task, there's higher
chance that that piece of code can be separated and recombined well with others (which does other small, defined task of their
own well.)

# Reuse
A good sign that your program is modular is when you can reuse something over and over again.

Classes and objects is a way to be modular. You can define a class once and use it over and over again, hopefully
in many different contexts.

Using functions is another way to be modular. You can define a function once, and use it over and over again.

See next chapter for an example.
