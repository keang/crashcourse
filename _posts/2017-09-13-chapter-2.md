We will see some examples in psudo codes, which are lines that looks like codes, conveying the
intentions of each step, but they aren't necessarily syntactically correct for any real languages.

An example code block may look like this (we'll talk about the dot between `myDog` and `bark` in the next article):
```
my_robot_dog.name
>> "Sam"
```
The values printed after `>>` are values that is returned from our preceding code.
Here when we check the name of our dog, the value "Sam" is returned.
His name "Sam" is a data that he holds.

```
my_robot_dog.bark
>> *imaginary bark heard*
my_robot_dog.sit
>> *imaginary sitting*
```
There are no actual values returned from the command `my_robot_dog.bark`, but instead
we should be able to observe a side effect of this if the robot dog was real.

Often we need to sprinkle human-targetted comments in our programs.
To do that in our pseudocodes, we use `//`

```
my_robot_dog.bark // The command before the double
                  // slash would invoke my dog to start barking

my_robot_dog.eat(my_homework) // but it will look like an accident.
// double slash marks the start of comments.
// Comments do not get interpretted by machines or robot dogs.
// They are meant for other human readers of the code.

```

Here my_robot_dog objects contains the "name" data, and can do dog stuff like barking, sitting and eating homeworks.
