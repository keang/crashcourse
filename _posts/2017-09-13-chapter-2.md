We will see some examples in javascript codes.  An example code block may look like this:

```js
my_robot_dog.name
< "Sam"
```

The values printed after `<` are values that is returned from our preceding code.
Here when we use `.` to check the name of our dog, the value "Sam" is returned.
His name "Sam" is a data field that he holds.

```js
my_robot_dog.bark()
< // imaginary bark heard
my_robot_dog.sit()
< // imaginary sitting
```
Some actions that my dog can do is `bark()` and `sit()`. We distinguish actions(or formallly methods) from
a data field by appending `()`.
There are no actual values returned from the command `my_robot_dog.bark()`, but instead
we should be able to observe a side effect of this if the robot dog was real. For now
I just leave a comment at where the return value is supposed to be.

Often we need to sprinkle human-targetted comments in our programs.
To do that in our pseudocodes, we use `//`

```js
my_robot_dog.bark() // The command before the double
                    // slash would invoke my dog to start barking
<

my_robot_dog.eat(my_homework) // but it will look like an accident.
<
// double slash marks the start of comments.
// Comments do not get interpretted by machines or robot dogs.
// They are meant for other human readers of the code.

```

Here `my_robot_dog` is an object, which contains its own `name`, and can do dog stuff like `bark()`, `sit()` and `eat(homework)`.
