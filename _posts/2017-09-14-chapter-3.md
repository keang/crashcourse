Armed with some basic data types, we can define our own classes. This is usually needed in most meaningful programs.

# Tooling

We will see some examples in psudocodes, which are lines that looks like codes, conveying the
intentions of each step, but they aren't necessarily syntactically correct for any real languages.

An example code block may look like this (we'll talk about the dot between `myDog` and `bark` in the next article):
```
my_robot_dog.bark
my_robot_dog.sit
```

Often we need to sprinkle human-targetted comments in our programs.
To do that in our pseudocodes, we use `//`

```
my_robot_dog.bark // The command before the double
                  // slash would invoke my dog to start barking

my_robot_dog.eat(my_homework) // but it will look like an accident.
// double slash marks the start of comments.
// Comments do not get interpretted by machines or robot dogs.
// They are meant for other human readers of the code.

```

# Pseudo Bank

On to the actual example for this article.

Let's say we want to write a program that calculates compound interests earned from a savings account. If we use OOP paradigm
to organise this piece of code, it's a good idea to start with defining the representations of savings account.

```
class SavingsAccount {
  account_holder       char[50]  // This denotes an array of 50 characters, or a string of length 50
  account_number       char[10]
  balance              float
  annual_interest_rate float
}
```

That's the blueprint for our savings account. It requires an account holder, an account number both are strings (of different maximum length)
and a balance amount as well as the interest rates. A possible instance of a SavingsAccount may look like this:

```
SavingsAccount(
  account_holder:       "Rick Sanchez",
  account_number:       "87654AB",
  balance:              1000.00,
  annual_interest_rate: 0.005
)
```

If we recall, arrays is a construct for holding a sequence anything. So we can have an array of SavingsAccount in a Bank:
```
class Bank {
  active_savings_account SavingsAccount[1000]  // This fake bank only serves maximum 1000 accounts
  bank_address           char[100]
}
```

We've managed to represent the simplistic ideas of banks and saving accounts, starting with strings and floats only.
Our classes `Bank` and `SavingsAccount` are composite/complex data types.

Using only strings and floats and arrays, we can construct composite data types, or our custom classes.
