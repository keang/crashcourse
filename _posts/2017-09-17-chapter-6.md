<div class="notice" markdown="1">
You may or may not have seen a mathematical function written like below:

f(x) = axÂ² + bx + c

Give it a value `x`, the function *returns* some value back.
That is called a function.
</div>

In programming, we define lots of such functions. Generally, it's a block of code where we give it some inputs, let it do some work, and wait for the return value.

For example, in javascript we can define the above quadratic function by writing:

```js
f = function(x) {
  return a * x**2 + b * x + c
}

// define required constants parameters
a = 10
b = 2
c = -4.6

f(3.6)
< 132.20000000000002 // you may try out in your console to see the return value
```

# To avoid repeating ourselves

We use functions in programs to avoid repeating ourselves, because there are bound to be repetitive things needed to be instructed. For this reason we always want to give functions descriptive names, which should help human readers of the code guess what the function does or return.

Sometimes the input can be empty; sometimes the return value can be empty.

```js
bark = function() {
  alert("Woof") // "alert" is a built-in browser function that we can use
                // "alert" takes an input String and do stuff with it
                // try this code and you'll see
}
bark() // notice this function takes no input, and doesn't return anything
```

# To be actions/methods of objects

Recall that objects have data fields that holds information and methods that does things. These methods where things get done are basically written as functions that we can attach to the object.

```js
class RoboDog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
    this.bark = function() { // basically a function named "bark"
      alert("Woof")
    }
  }
}
// create our dog, giving a name
my_robot_dog = new RoboDog("Sam")

// check our dog's name, notice we don't need the "()"
my_robot_dog.name
< "Sam"

// call our dog's method
my_robot_dog.bark()
```
