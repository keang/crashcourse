The actions that these basic data types can do, like `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, `&&`, etc are special actions that the language
give special status to. Instead of "methods", they are called "operators".

# Some common operators

|Notation|Description|Example |
|---|---|
|+|Addition| 5 + 3|
|-|Subtraction| 5 - 3|
|*|Multiplication| 5 * 3|
|/|Division| 5 / 3|
|**|Exponentiation / power| 5 ** 3|
|%|Modulus / remainder| 5 % 3|
|&&| AND operator| awesome && cool|
|\|\|| OR operator| awesome \|\| cool|
|!| NOT operator| !awesome |
|==| Equal (check if two values are equal) | 5 == 3|
|<| Less than| 5 < 3|
|>| Greater than| 5 > 3|
|<=| Less than or equal| 5 <= 3|
|>=| Greater than or equal| 5 >= 3|
|!=| Not equal | 5 != 3|

# Assignment
`=` is the assignment operator:

```js
awesome = true
x = 5
```

It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. In the new javascript standard, whenever a new variable pops up, we should use
"let" at the beginning. So this reads more naturally:
```
let awesome = true
let x = 5
```

After this we can use these variables in our succeeding codes:

```js
x + 3
< 8 // this returns 8 because x has been assigned as 5 earlier
```

```js
!awesome
< false // this is false because "awesome" is true, as assigned earlier
```
