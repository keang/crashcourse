Armed with some basic data types, we can define our own classes. This is usually needed in most meaningful programs.

# Pseudo Bank

On to the actual example for this article.

Let's say we want to write a program that calculates compound interests earned from a savings account. If we use OOP paradigm
to organise this piece of code, it's a good idea to start with defining the representations of savings account.

```ruby
class SavingsAccount {
  account_holder       char[50]  // This denotes an array of 50 characters, or a string of length 50
  account_number       char[10]
  balance              float
  annual_interest_rate float
}
```

But to prepare our program to be extensible, (and also to demonstrate class inheritance,) we can break the SavingsAccount further:
```java
class BankAccount {
  account_holder       char[50]
  account_number       char[10]
  balance              float
}

// The below '<' notation means that SavingsAccount
// has all the definitions that BankAccount has,
// plus everything that follows

class SavingsAccount < BankAccount {
  annual_interest_rate float
}
```

That's the blueprint for our savings account. It requires an account holder, an account number both are strings (of different maximum length)
and a balance amount as well as the interest rates. A possible instance of a SavingsAccount may look like this:

```java
SavingsAccount(
  account_holder:       "Rick Sanchez",
  account_number:       "87654AB",
  balance:              1000.00,
  annual_interest_rate: 0.005
)
```

If we recall, arrays is a construct for holding a sequence anything. So we can have an array of SavingsAccount in a Bank:
```java
class Bank {
  active_savings_account SavingsAccount[1000]  // This fake bank only serves maximum 1000 accounts
  bank_address           char[100]
}
```

We've managed to represent the simplistic ideas of banks and saving accounts, starting with strings and floats only.
Our classes `Bank` and `SavingsAccount` are composite/complex data types.

Using only strings and floats and arrays, we can construct composite data types, or our custom classes.
