Armed with some basic data types, we can define our own classes. This is usually needed in most meaningful programs.

# Pseudo Bank

On to the actual example for this article.

Let's say we want to write a program that calculates compound interests earned from a savings account. If we use OOP paradigm
to organise this piece of code, it's a good idea to start with defining the representations of savings account.
Copy and paste the codes to try out (Don't copy the lines starting with `<` )

```js
class SavingsAccount {
  constructor(holder, name, bal, rates) { // these represents values passed into the constructor method
    // our simple constructor basically keep all the values passed in
    this.account_holder = holder
    this.account_number = name
    this.balance        = bal
    this.ir_percents    = rates // annual interest rates, in number of percents
  }
}
< undefined // this is because the command above does not return anything
```

That's the blueprint for our savings account. It requires an account holder, an account number both are strings (of different maximum length)
and a balance amount as well as the interest rates. A possible instance of a SavingsAccount may look like this:

```js
my_account = new SavingsAccount("Rick Sanchez", "1232234", 1000.0, 5)
my_account.balance
<
my_account.account_holder
<
```

If we recall, arrays is a construct for holding a sequence anything. So we can have an array of SavingsAccount in a Bank:
```js
class Bank {
  constructor(address) {
    this.active_account = [] // this is an array of account, starting empty
    this.bank_address = address
  }
}
FakeBank = new Bank("123 John Street")  // constructs a fake bank
FakeBank.active_account.push(my_account) // associates our account earlier with this bank
FakeBank.active_account // lists down all active accounts so far
```

We've managed to represent the simplistic ideas of banks and saving accounts, starting with strings and floats only.
Our classes `Bank` and `SavingsAccount` are composite/complex data types.

Using only strings and floats and arrays, we can construct composite data types, or our custom classes.
